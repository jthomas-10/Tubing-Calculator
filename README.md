A comprehensive Python application for calculating mass, volume, and total length of tubing systems for space vehicle engineering applications.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Tube & Pipe Calculations**: Support for standard tube and pipe sizes
- **Multi-segment Systems**: Add multiple tube segments with different properties
- **Unit Conversion**: Switch between metric (SI) and imperial units
- **Material Database**: Includes common aerospace materials (SS316L, Al6061-T6, Ti-6Al-4V, Inconel 625, Copper)
- **Export Capabilities**: Download results as Excel or CSV files

### Advanced Features
- **2D Visualization**: Professional-grade plots showing system layout, diameter distribution, mass distribution, and volume distribution
- **Continuous/Separate Segments**: Define whether segments connect or are separate
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant updates as you modify parameters
- **Professional UI**: Modern, sleek interface built with Streamlit

### Calculations
The app automatically calculates:
- **Internal Volume**: Fluid volume capacity
- **Material Volume**: Volume of tube/pipe material
- **Mass**: Total mass based on material density
- **Total Length**: Sum of all segments
- **Outer/Inner Diameters**: Based on standard sizes and wall thickness

## Installation

1. **Install Python Requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run tube_calculator.py
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**:
   The app will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Adding Segments
1. Enter a segment name
2. Select tube type (Tube or Pipe)
3. Choose standard size from dropdown
4. Select wall thickness
